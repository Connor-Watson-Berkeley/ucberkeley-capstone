Parameter Optimization

Modern parameter optimization using Optuna for strategy tuning.

Key improvements over diagnostics/run_diagnostic_16.py:
- Optimizes for efficiency ratio (not just raw earnings)
- Uses production backtest engine
- Integrates with theoretical maximum benchmark
- Supports multi-objective optimization

Note: For now, use diagnostics/run_diagnostic_16.py for parameter optimization.
      This module is under development to provide a modern, integrated approach.
