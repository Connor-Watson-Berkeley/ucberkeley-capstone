# 🚀 MEGA SESSION SUMMARY - All Night Experimentation

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Session:** Advanced Models, Sentiment Analysis, Panel Data & More!
**Models Created:** 25+ total models
**Status:** 🔥 RUNNING ALL NIGHT

---

## 🎯 What We Built Tonight

### New Model Architectures

#### 1. **NeuralProphet Models** (Deep Learning)
- `NeuralProphet` - Neural network with auto-seasonality
- `NeuralProphet+Weather` - With weather covariates
- `NeuralProphet+Deep` - Extended lags (30) + 200 epochs

**Why exciting:** First deep learning model with dynamic covariates!

#### 2. **Panel Data Model** (Cross-Commodity Learning)
- `Panel-XGBoost` - Learns from Coffee + Sugar together
- Uses commodity fixed effects
- Leverages cross-commodity patterns

**Why innovative:** Treats commodities as panel individuals - borrows strength across series!

#### 3. **XGBoost Variants** (4 new flavors)
- `XGBoost+UltraDeep` - 11 lags, 9 windows (ultra-deep structure)
- `XGBoost+Minimal` - Temp only, 2 lags (minimalist)
- `XGBoost+ShortTerm` - Optimized for short-term patterns
- `XGBoost+LongTerm` - Optimized for long-term patterns

#### 4. **Sentiment-Enhanced Models**
- `XGBoost+Sentiment` - GDELT sentiment features only
- `XGBoost+Weather+Sentiment` - Combined weather + sentiment
- `XGBoost+Full` - ALL features (weather + sentiment + deep lags)

**Status:** ⚠️ Sentiment HURTS performance (confirmed experimentally)
